* `..` or `Â·` semigroup operation
  * String concatentation
* `+` group-like operation, field-like addition
  * Numeric addition
* `-` group-like operation, field-like subtraction
  * Numeric subtraction

  * Numeric multiplication
* `/` group-like inverse operation, field-like division
  * Numeric division
* `or` boolean or

# Unary Operators

* `-` group/field additive inverse
* `/` group/field multiplicative inverse
* `not` boolean inverse

# Notes...

* No seperate binary/boolean operators, determined via overloading / type matching?
* `=` is never used to prevent confusion
* `_` and `'` are reserved for use in identifiers
